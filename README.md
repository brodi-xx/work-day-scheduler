# 05 Third-Party APIs: Work Day Scheduler

## Your Task

In this project, I took pre-existing starter code and modified a simple calendar application to allow a user to save events for each hour of the day. This app will run in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

I used [Day.js](https://day.js.org/en/) library to work with date and time as well as utilized TAs, professional/personal mentor, google, W3 schools, and youtube to get this project to completion.

## User Story
